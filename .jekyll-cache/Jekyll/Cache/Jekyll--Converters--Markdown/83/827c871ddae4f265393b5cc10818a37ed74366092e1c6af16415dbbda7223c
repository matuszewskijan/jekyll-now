I"(<p>Are you running a project related to healthcare or medical industry and looking for experienced developer? I might be the person you are looking for.</p>

<p>During my 4 years of professional career I’ve the possibility to work on dozens of Ruby on Rails projects, but the ones excites me the most are medical related ones. Why? This kind of project gives me the sense of accomplishment that I bring real value for the world.</p>

<p>Let me choose few projects from many others I’ve worked on and describe them quickly with short summary of tasks I’ve worked on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>COVID-19 Vaccination Passport Platform - built from scratch back end infrastructure issuing COVID-19 vaccination passports for major German city with over 500 000 citizens. Built highly scalable and secure queuing system using Redis and Sidekiq. Integrated with global passport generation API provided by IBM.</li>
  <li>Platform for Physiotherapists - been working on a major telehealth platform with a team of 20 other developers. I was responsible for rebuild of search functionality in the system, what I did with great success achieving 10x performance improvement.</li>
  <li>Healthcare Startup Investments platform - my main responsibility there were improving code quality by implementing unit tests for the project which were lacking them earlier.</li>
  <li>Platform for booking MRI scans - helped the startup to expand into new areas by building their second Ruby on Rails application. Took care of project maintenance and code quality by implementing unit and integration tests alongside with continuous integration.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the mentioned projects were based on the Ruby on Rails framework, it’s the technology I feel the most comfortable with, however, I am not scared by working in other technologies(already worked on a few small projects in Python, Node.js, and Elixir).</p>

<p>I am hoping that my profile sparked a little interest in you and we will talk about how I can add value to your project soon!</p>
