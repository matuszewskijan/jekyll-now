During the years of my professional career, I have had the possibility to work on dozens of Ruby on Rails projects. All of the opportunities made me realize that besides software craftsmanship the thing I enjoy the most is:

#### Connecting programming knowledge with business goals

My mission is to make the world a better place, and to acomplish that I am giving my best developing applications that are helping as many people as possible.

##### Background

At age of 15 I started my first online business - a blog with game hacks promoting Cash-per-action campaigns. I am not proud of it as it wasn't fully legal, but it's where my journey started so I won't skip this part.
The next step was monetizing fanpages, then I started working on affiliate campaigns what led me to **my first programming project:**

I've created an eCommerce shop in **Ruby on Rails** from scratch. The idea were to pull products from the Aliexpress API and connect all of the links to my partner account. The project was a painful failure earning only 2.5$ after endless hours of development work and content creation.

#### Failures are only lessons

During the work on this project I learned that programming is my big passion, I love creating things and I am naturally good at it. It was the breakpoint - **I decided to do be a professional programmer.**
*(I have to mention that it is a much more stable source of income than online business.)*

It leads to my first two years in a full-time time position as a **Ruby developer**. I've learned a lot hard skills, but never really felt that my work brings real value to the business I work on. I used to be involved in much more aspects of the business than only the technical domain, and I have been missing it.

##### Switching to freelance

Because of the seeking of my fullfilment I decided to leave my safety spot with regular salary and start working as a freelancer.

Why? This way I am closer to business, I prefer working in smaller teams, closer to the business people so we could exchange or face each other ideas. I am proactive team member who is always trying to find the best solution, best solution for the business, not for the manager above me.

I am learning everyday but I believe that my current knowledge from both worlds: **programming and business** is a true value.
If you also think so - I am open for any proposition and I would be very excited to work together!

I also invite you to [my blog](/blog) where I describe how I am tackling programming and business challenges. It's a great place to learn more about what and how I am doing things.
