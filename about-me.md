I’ve worked on dozens of Ruby on Rails projects — and what I’ve come to value most is **connecting code to real business impact**. I enjoy building software that solves problems and creates value.

My mission is simple: **build useful tools that help people** — and do it with care, discipline, and purpose.

### Where It Started

I launched my first online business at 15 — a (questionably legal) blog promoting game hacks and affiliate campaigns. Not something I’m proud of, but it sparked my interest in how software and business intersect.

That led to experiments in running fanpages, affiliate marketing, and eventually my first programming project: an eCommerce shop built from scratch in Ruby on Rails using the AliExpress API. Financially, it was a total failure — but it made me fall in love with programming which changed everything.

### Failure → Clarity

That experience showed me what I care about most: **building things that matter**.
I realized I didn’t just enjoy writing code — I loved solving problems, owning the process, and seeing things through.

So I pursued programming professionally. I spent two years in a full-time Ruby role, learning the craft and honing my skills — but I missed having visibility into the business side of the work. I wasn’t close to the decisions, the users, or the outcomes.

### Freelance: Getting Closer to What Matters

Looking for more involvement and ownership, I left full-time employment and started freelancing. I prefer small teams, direct contact with decision-makers, and being trusted to figure things out — not just take orders.

I care about finding the **right solution for the business**, not just the one that pleases a manager. I ask questions, suggest improvements, and look for ways to simplify.

## Where I Am Now

I’m a **developer who understands both code and context**.
My technical background combined with hands-on business experience lets me bridge both worlds. That’s where I deliver the most value.

If that sounds like someone you’d want to work with — I’d love to talk.
