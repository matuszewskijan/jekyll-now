During the years I've helped dozens of companies with my expertise:

### Building COVID-19 passport issuing platform with [Pairing.dev](https://pairing.dev/){:target="_blank"}:
Easily one of the top 3 Freelancers I've ever worked with. The technical complexity Jan is able to grasp is astounding. He was on point in every call, even worked overtime when needed, and delivered a solution without bugs. We worked closely in an agile team, and I'm a Senior dev myself who checked all his code. 100% test coverage. If you have a tough nut to crack, call Jan. He'll get it done. 5/5 would hire again!

### Ruby on Rails Development for [Scan.com](https://scan.com/){:target="_blank"}:
Jan has worked with us now for a while on a number of different projects. He is a super hard working developer that gets almost anything you throw at home done quickly and at a high standard. I highly recommend him for any full stack projects, especially Ruby on Rails with React.

### Ruby on Rails / Elixir Development for [Charper Bonaroo](https://bonaroo.nl/){:target="_blank"}:
He is a great all-round developer that's there when you need him. Just give him something to do and he does what's being asked, not more, not less, without wasting resources or asking too many questions. Delivered code fits the project's style and doesn't stand out negatively. Jan also has no problems with improving the project by improving documentation or setting up CIs or deployment targets.

### Fix broken Rails application, code quality review for [BioMark](https://www.biomarking.com/){:target="_blank"}:
We had a broken project and he came in and got it running in no time! Later, we asked him to do a code review of our Ruby on Rails codebase, and he did a terrific job with his many recommendations. Would hire again if we have more Ruby work.
